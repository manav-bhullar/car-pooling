## The Problem It Solves
Traditional ride-hailing pairs one driver with one rider. Floq dynamically clusters multiple riders heading in the same general direction and optimizes their pickup/drop-off sequence. It ensures that no passenger experiences an unacceptable detour while maximizing driver earnings and vehicle capacity.

## Key Engineering Decisions

1. **Concurrency Control in Ride Matching (Preventing Double-Matches)**
   Ride matching is triggered via a cron job every 45 seconds. To prevent race conditions if multiple server instances are running, the system employs a two-layer defense:
   - **Distributed Locking:** Uses a Redis `SET NX PX` lock (`matching:cron:lock` with a 5-minute TTL) to ensure only one instance executes the matching logic. Lua scripts handle atomic check-and-delete during release.
   - **Row-Level DB Locks:** The matcher fetches pending ride requests using PostgreSQL's `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. This guarantees that if a transaction is processing a set of requests, other concurrent queries will skip them rather than blocking or reading dirty data.

2. **Route Sequence Optimization & Detour Limits**
   When grouping 2-4 users, the system calculates all valid pickup/drop-off permutations (using backtracking to ensure pickups always precede drop-offs). It evaluates each sequence's total distance. Crucially, it calculates the **detour ratio** for *every individual user* in the sequence. If any user's detour exceeds `MAX_USER_DETOUR` (30%), the entire grouping is rejected, ensuring fairness.

3. **Real-Time Location via Redis Cache-Aside & Socket.io**
   High-frequency driver GPS updates are pushed via WebSockets (`driverLocationUpdate`). Instead of hammering the database, the server persists the latest coordinates in Redis (`driver:location:{tripId}`) with a 60-second TTL. When new riders join the trip room (`joinTrip`), they immediately receive the cached location for an instant map pin, rather than waiting for the driver's next GPS tick.

4. **Multi-Tier Rate Limiting**
   Implemented a fixed-window rate limiter using Redis `INCR` and `EXPIRE`. It is applied differentially:
   - **Auth Routes:** Strict limit (10 req / 15 min per IP) to prevent brute-force attacks on login, registration, and OTP endpoints.
   - **API Routes:** Relaxed limit (100 req / 1 min per authenticated `userId`) to prevent abuse while accommodating normal usage. The middleware is designed to fail open if Redis goes down, ensuring the API remains available.

5. **OSRM Routing with Haversine Fallback**
   To calculate accurate fare and ETA, the system queries the OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) API for real-world road distances. Because network calls can fail, the system includes a reliable fallback: it calculates the Haversine (straight-line) distance and multiplies it by a tested `ROAD_TO_HAVERSINE_CORRECTION` factor (1.35) to estimate the road distance without stalling the request.

## Load Testing
A `k6` load testing script is configured to simulate high-concurrency ride request creation and matching. 

To run the scenario locally:
```bash
k6 run server/load-tests/matching-scenario.js
```

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Concurrent Users | 50 | *Pending run* |
| Request Duration (p95) | < 500ms | *Pending run* |
| Error Rate | < 1% | *Pending run* |

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS (assumed based on standard Vite apps) |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Real-Time** | Socket.io |
| **Database & ORM** | PostgreSQL, Prisma (`@prisma/client`) |
| **Caching & Locks** | Redis (`ioredis`) |
| **Routing / Maps** | OSRM API |
| **Background Jobs** | `node-cron` |

## Testing
The repository includes a comprehensive test suite covering the Redis integration phases, caching logic, distributed locking, and rate limiting.

- **Total Tests:** 108/108 Passing (across Redis caching, OTP, Auth, Rate Limiting, and Locking phases on the `redis-implementation` branch).
- **Coverage:** Unit and integration tests verify cache invalidation, Redis TTL auto-expiry, transaction integrity during cascade cancellations, and matching constraints.

*Note: The test runner requires a local PostgreSQL instance running on port `5432` for DB-dependent tests to pass.*

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd car-pooling/server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables (`server/.env`):**
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/carpool_db"
   REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
   PORT=5050
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your_email
   SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Known Limitations / What I'd Improve Next
- **Matching Engine Scaling:** Currently, the matching engine pulls pending requests in batches. If the pending pool grows massively, scoring every possible pair $O(n^2)$ will bottleneck. Next step: Implement PostGIS or Redis geospatial indexing to only score pairs within a 5km radius.
- **Missing `run-tests.js` in `main`:** The root script `scripts/run-tests.js` is referenced in `package.json` but is currently missing on the `main` branch. 
- **Driver Rejection Handling:** The `DriverTrip` model supports a `CANCELLED` state, but there isn't a robust mechanism to rapidly re-queue a `RIDERS_MATCHED` trip to a different driver if the first driver rejects it, leading to potential auto-expiry.
